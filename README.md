# books

This project was my first attempt at producing a book database with web user interface following my studies at university. It makes use of PHP and a mySQL database, and in truth worked perfectly for my needs, for years it allowed me to track books i wanted to read and those that i had already read. It run nicely on my Raspberry Pi.

This is simply a commit to keep a copy somewhere safe should i ever decide to pick it back up and reuse it.
